title: Pulseq Implementation in GPI Lab
---
## What is Pulseq
From [pulseq.github.io](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq): Pulseq is an open source framework for the development, representation and execution of magnetic resonance (MR) sequences. A central contribution of this project is an open file format to compactly describe MR sequences suitable for execution on an MRI scanner or NMR spectrometer. MATLAB and C++ source code is provided for reading and writing sequence files.

## What is GPI Lab
From [gpilab.com](http://gpilab.com): GPI provides a visual workspace for assembling algorithms. Algorithm elements (i.e. nodes) can be linked together to form a flow diagram. Each node is executed according to the hierarchy of the diagram.

## GPI Lab + Pulseq
The MATLAB 'mr' toolbox has been ported to work with GPI Lab, written in Python 3. Check the repo for more info.
